# Python
You will write functions that demonstrate and extrapolate specific facets of probability/stats and/or Python. 
These functions will build on each other. We expect you to be familiar with common Python built-ins, including: 
abs(), bool(), chr(), dict(), enumerate(), float(), input(), int(), len(), list(), max(), min(), ord(), 
print(), range(), round(), set(), sorted(), str(), sum(), tuple(), and type(). 
We expect you to understand and be able to iterate through, manipulate, 
and utilize functions related to these Python data structures: list, dictionary, set, and tuple.

See the Python 3 Built-in Functions
https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html.
See the Python 3 Data Structures
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html

We expect you to be familiar with function declaration, syntax and usage. 
We expect you to know how to import python module functions and utilize them. 
The only imported module with which we expect you to have some experience is the math module: 
https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html 

```python
1. abs()
2. bool()
3. chr()
4. dict()
5. enumerate()
..* [notes]
6. float()
7. input()
8. int()
9. len()
10. list() 
11. max()
12. min()
13. ord()
14. print() 
15. range()
16. round()
17. set()
18. sorted()
19. str()
20. sum()
21. tuple()
22. type()
```

# Probability/Statistics
We expect that you will understand fundamental concepts in statistics. 
These may include measures of central tendency, error metrics, and least squares regression. 
You will leverage your experience in solving probability problems, 
including those related to combinations and permutations. You may be asked to apply conditional probability, 
including the law of total probability and Bayes theorem.
You will have a basic working knowledge of the Binomial and Poisson distributions. 
Your TAO may ask you to interpret plots, such as histograms, boxplots, and other distribution visualizations.
